Add player-built buildings/stuff

IDEA
Refresh ht and hp completely at towns? For a price?
For buildings - have preset options that require set amounts of resources? Similar to Hearthfire?
Be able to place a chest and store resources in a certain location, later to return.
Visual representation of map? Include user-placed things and show whether settlements have been visited/raided/etc.
Enemies scaling with player?

MAINLOOP QUESTION
Game Engine in C++ but prompt querying in python so I can use prompt_toolkit to get auto-completions and so on? If so, call python from C++ mainloop, or call C++ functions from python mainloop?
Could create a c++ wrapper on c++ GameEngine taking in int argument for function number, and then use python mainloop to call it.

TEST
check and rework damage formulae
