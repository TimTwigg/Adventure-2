look around? (list all directions)

Replace Liquid class with enum class in Container.hpp
Container enable set amount

finish Civilization::setTrades() - add animals, potions, machines etc
Add player-built buildings/stuff
chopping trees removes them if not in forest?
crafting things like ammo crafts more than 1
Add machine use commands (smoke uses smoker already, need to add command for furnace)
finish object_info.json - fill in blanks marked by "@@@"

IDEA
Refresh ht and hp completely at towns? For a price?
For buildings - have preset options that require set amounts of resources? Similar to Hearthfire?
Be able to place a chest and store resources in a certain location, later to return.
Visual representation of map? Include user-placed things and show whether settlements have been visited/raided/etc.
Ability to name sections of a map? Search for named section and get direction towards it?
Enemies scaling with player?
Civilization resets trades after a while?
Civilizations and entities heal over time?
Log user commands?
Able to sleep anywhere or must it be safe? What about bed? Do you heal overnight?
Create "Make Item" function that creates the shared ptr. Maybe in Map? Then Player::addItem would take that object as param

MAINLOOP QUESTION
Game Engine in C++ but prompt querying in python so I can use prompt_toolkit to get auto-completions and so on? If so, call python from C++ mainloop, or call C++ functions from python mainloop?
Could create a c++ wrapper on c++ GameEngine taking in int argument for function number, and then use python mainloop to call it.

TEST
check and rework damage formulae
